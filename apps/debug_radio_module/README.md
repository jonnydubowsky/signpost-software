Debug Radio Module
==================

Development "fake radio" module on the Debug Backplane. Capable of shuttling
data from modules over UART. The Debug Radio Module is responsible for
providing the Networking API to modules.

The Debug Radio Module is designed to work with the debug_radio_receiver
script such that it can perform actual networking requests. Please
see the documentation at for this [radio receiver](software/receiver/fake_radio)
