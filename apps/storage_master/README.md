Storage Master
==============

One of the two microcontrollers on the Control Module (the other being the
Controller). The Storage Master is responsible for providing a Storage API to
modules and recording that data non-volatilely on an attached SD card. It is
also responsible for providing access to the attached Intel Edison and
controlling its power state.
