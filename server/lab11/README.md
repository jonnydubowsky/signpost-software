Lab11
======

This contains lab11-specific server-side parsing software. This parses
are raw buffers published to the external MQTT broker and sends
them to several databases.

These are intended to be run along with several scripts from the
[Gateway](https://github.com/lab11/gateway) repository which actually
sends data to our databases.
