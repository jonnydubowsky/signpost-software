Signpost Bootloader
===================

Generic bootloader for all Signpost modules. Does not actually function as a
bootloader, but rather just jumps to the kernel on boot. The purpose is to
provide a structured space to store attributes which can be used to determine
how to program the board. The source and more information can be found on
[github](https://github.com/helena-project/tock-bootloader).
