LoRa XDOT Radio Test
====================

This test joins a test network setup in Berkeley, then sends data on
that test network repeatedly.

To use the test compile with your network key in ascii, which will
automatically be converted and compiled into a hex string in the app.

```
make PASSWORD=16_character_string
```
