RFExplorer Test App
===================

This is a test application for using the RFexplorer module within the 
Mbed framework. It specifically works with the Signpost RF Spectrum module.

Currently the application initializes the RF Spectrum module to 2400baud
then continuously listens and performs peak detection on the LoRa frequency band.
